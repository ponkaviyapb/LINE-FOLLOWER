# LINE-FOLLOWER
# Overview
A Line Follower Robot is an autonomous robot that follows a predefined path,usually marked by a black line on a white surface. This project uses
sensors to detect the line and control motors to follow the path efficiently.

# Features
            âœ¨ Autonomous navigation along a marked path
            âœ¨ Real-time line detection using IR sensors
            âœ¨ Smooth speed control for efficient movement
            âœ¨ Ability to handle curves and intersections
